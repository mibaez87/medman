Medman is a medication management app designed to help families and caregivers keep track of current medications and upcoming refills. TO begin, users can sign up and add family members. Each family member has their own profile where users can add and view prescription details.

Future enhancements include: correcting db functions so that users only see user specific data when logged in, adding different pharmacies to keep track of which prescriptions get filled where, additional functionality for editing and archiving both family members and prescriptions, and input validation.
